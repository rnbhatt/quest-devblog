    <p>
      For the past two weeks, I was assigned two major tasks, both being battle attacks. In addition, I also addressed other aspects of the projects.
    </p>
  <strong>Convince Attack</strong>
  <p>
    The Convince attack has the player dodging walls that cross the screen from right to left. Each wall has a random height, and a hole in the middle for the player to pass through. 
    It's meant to be a metaphor for bringing down barriers when convincing another person
    of a position, as far as I can tell. Since we now have a fairly solid foundation for modeling battles, the implementation went fairly smoothlly.

</p>
  <p>
    Our decision to implement battles inside of a UI Canvas is probably going to cause problems for us. I have already noticed inconsistent sprite sizes and player movement
  speed across the different computers that I've used to work on the game, and it seems like it is tied to the DPI of the display. At the present moment, it is probably too
  late to re-engineer battles to take place in a normal 2D scene rather than a canvas, but I will raise this concern at the next studio meeting. Needing to manually account for
  DPI and operating system UI scale factors every single place we need them is going to create an endless supply of bugs, whereas in a normal 2D scene the resolution of the display
  does not matter because everything happens in scene coordinates instead of pixels. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Edit: After the meeting today (10/22) we agreed that changing the battles to take place in world space is the way to go. However, we decided to delay that work for one week until after feature lock, 
    so that we can reduce the chances of needing to redo work. The main changes that will need to happen are:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create a prefab (or a scene and use additive scene loading) that contains the battle arena, and place it on its own render layer
      </li>
      <li>
        Change all the recttransforms to normal transforms
      </li>
      <li>
        Change all of the UI Image elements to standard sprites
      </li>
      <li>
        Change the amount that objects move in one frame, since UI pixel coordinates are a lot larger than world coordinates
      </li>
      <li>
        To display the battle area, swap the active camera to the battle camera and disable the overworld camera
      </li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <strong>Heal Attack</strong>
  <p>
    The heal "attack" allows the player to have a chance to regain lost health. It works by spawning flowers in random places on the board, and after a random interval the flowers
    will burst petals. If the player touches a petal, then they regain 3 hp as according to the design doc. This was the first place where I decided to voluntarily use the EventBus. 
    In the past, I defaulted to creating trees of objects, with backpointers to parents, so that information can be transmitted between objects, but this always became a mess
    very quickly. Since the Heal minigame has three levels of object (the minigame, the flowers, and the petals), I decided to have the petals raise an EventBus message whenever the player
    contacted them, and have the minigame recieve those events, applying a hp increase each time. 
    <figure>
      <img src="heal.png" style="width:100%; max-width:600px">
      <figcaption>Screenshot of the WIP heal attack, also using placeholder sprites.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    I'm sold on the EventBus paradigm. Not only does it make the code cleaner, but it also allowed me to use lambda capturing to enforce encapsulation even better. 
  <pre>
public override void Play(MiniGameInfo info)
{
    // [cut for brevity]
    
    collisionSub = EventBus.Subscribe&gt;HealMiniGameFlowerPickup.Occurrence&lt((evt) =>
    {
        info.playerIcon.GetComponent&gt;PlayerBattleHealth&lt;().Heal(healAmountPerPickup);
    });
}
</pre>
          The subscriber to the event can capture the MiniGameInfo parameter in-place. This is very convienient because it means I do not need to create a member function that other code can
          call by accident. Instead, the concerns are properly isolated. I think I will supply an EventBus as a first-party feature in my own game engine, though mine will need some
          additional engineering in order to be thread safe and properly handle the fact that my engine moves data around in memory a lot, wheras Unity keeps objects in stable locations and
          scripts are single threaded. 
  </p>
<strong>Diagnostics screen</strong>
          <p>
            I ported this script from Ragnarok TD. At any point in the game, pressing F3 will display a textual overlay containing the game's current frame rate, the physics tick rate, and
            information about the rendering backend and enabled features. This overlay will help us diagnose problems in final builds, because it allows us to easily get a view of 
            the machine's configuration. It is also a lot easier to tell a tester to press F3 and take a screenshot than it is to ask them to look up and give us their specs. 
          </p>
  <strong>Build optimization</strong>
          <p>
            I made a few changes to our compile configuration to optimize performance in release builds. I switched the scripting backend to il2cpp and enabled link-time optimization, because
            this feature provides a performance uplift compared to mono essentially for free. The only downside is making final release builds takes a little bit longer, but to me that is a 
            worthwhile tradeoff. I also disabled features we don't use and enabled the multithreaded render backend. Even though we are making a simple 2D game, I believe that performance
            is still a top priority. Even if we end up capping the frame rate to the monitor refresh rate, reducing the amount of time the game spends performing computations will help reduce
            our power consuption, enabling longer battery life on laptops. 
          </p>
  <strong>Devblog enhancements</strong>
  <p>
    This does not count in my hours. I made some usability improvements to the devblog compared to the extremely basic devblog I created for my Ragnarok TD work.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The blog now uses the system UI font, chosen automatically per platform. This should be easier on the eyes than the browser default font of Times New Roman.
      </li>
      <li>
        This blog's color theme now follows your browser / OS setting. This means if you prefer dark mode, the blog will automatically theme itself to be dark. No JavaScript is 
        required to make this work, it's done purely with one CSS media query. 
      </li>
    </ul>
