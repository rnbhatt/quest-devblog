      For the past two weeks, I was assigned two major tasks. The first was to update all of the battle minigames to the new worldspace environment,
    and the second was to implement a new battle hooks API so that the UI team can add animations or other effects that play alongside battles.
    I also addressed some other minor aspects of the project.
    </p>
  <strong>Updating the Battle Minigames</strong>
  <p>
    The new battle minigame system takes place inside the main scene, rather than inside the canvas. We made this change because the canvas-based
    system required the battle minigames to be aware of DPI scaling in order to properly function on all users' devices, and it must
    respond to changes in that environment. For example, if the user plugs in an exteral display, or changes the UI scale factor
    inside their OS settings, the game needs to rescale the battle system on the fly. With world-space battles, this is no longer an issue.
    The camera projection matrix takes care of making everything the right size, so battles can now take place without needing to consider anything
    about the user's display configuration. Switching to a battle is as simple as activating the battle camera and deactivating the level camera. 
  </p>

    Updating all the minigames was not difficult, but it was extremely time-consuming and tedious. A few major changes needed to happen to each minigame:
    <ol>
      <li>All RectTransforms needed to become Transforms</li>
      <li>All Images needed to become Sprites</li>
      <li>The fightbox itself needed to be composed of sprites rather than as UI image elements.</li>
      <li>The minigame logic needed to make spawend objects a child of the fightbox world-space object rather than a canvas element</li>
      <li>The speed at which objects traveled needed to be reduced to make sense in world-space coordinates</li>
    </ol>
  I took the opportunity to make some enhancements to the fightbox API. The script now defines an Extent, with function to set it and retrieve it.

  Most of the minigames controlled their spawed objects entirely using code. However, one mingiame (the Calm attack) used unity animators. This one was
  less simple to update. I ended up re-creating the animation solely for the scale and iamge swap parts of it, while changing the falling part
  of the animation to code-driven, triggered by an animation event. This gave me more control over the objects than was possible with the animator.

  I spread out my work on udating battle minigames over the full two-week period to keep myself sane. 
      </p>
  <strong>Battle Hooks API</strong>
  <p>
    The UI and Narrative teams have expressed interest in having interludes during battles, to play dialog, cutscenes, or effects. Crucially, these
    interludes will be unpredictable lengths. Therefore, I designed an API for the battle system to make adding these interludes easy. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Because the interludes will need to play inline, I modified the battle system to allow pausing it and resuming it in a controlled fashion. Each hook is 
    exposed as a UnityEvent with one parameter: a C# Action. Actions take no parameters and return nothing, but they can contain lambda functions
    with capture state. To use a battle hook, one must connect their compatible function to the UnityEvent in the inspector, and inside that function,
    do whatever they need to do, and invoke the Action when complete. The Action contains the next piece of the battle logic, effectively unpausing it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    A BattleHook looks like this:
    <pre>
[Serializable]
public class BattleHook : UnityEvent&lt;Action&gt; {
    public void TryInvoke(Action e)
    {
        if (GetPersistentEventCount() > 0)
        {
            Invoke(e);
        }
        else
        {
            e();
        }
    }
}
    </pre>
   <figure>
      <img src="battlehooks.png" style="width:100%; max-width:300px">
      <figcaption>Battle Hooks in the inspector</figcaption>
    </figure>

    Within the battle controller, it's used like this:
  <pre>
beginPlayerTurn.TryInvoke(() =&gt;
   {
      // battle logic here...
    }
);
  </pre>
  TryInvoke will invoke the event if any subsscribers exist. If none exist, then it invokes the Action itself, so that the battle doesn't softlock
  if no overrides are bound. A more robust system would be able to handle multiple functions bound to the same event, since the current system
  will cause multiple instances of the battle to occur if the Action is invoked multiple times, but we are unlikely to need such robustness in Project Quest.
  </p>

  <strong>LDtk Postprocess Hook</strong>
  <p>
    LDtk is the external level editor that we use for creating environments. It assigns the Sprites/Default material to objects exported
    from it into Unity, which is a problem for us because of the tilemap edge-aliasing issue. We need the objects to have the PQSpriteMat material,
    which enables the fix for edge-aliasing. We can't just fix it manually in Unity because LDtk replaces the objects each time it exports, so any
    changes made in Unity would be lost. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The recommendation from the LDtk Discord server was to add a LDTK post processing script to our Unity project. I pair-programmed with
    the member that added Ldtk to our project to create this script. All that we needed to do was add a new script to the project that subclassed
    from LDtkPostprocessor and overrides the OnPostprocessLevel function. Inside this function, we load the PQSpriteMat from the resources folder, 
    and apply it to every object that LDtk created. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This approach worked, but it only runs when new data is exported from Ldtk, something which only works on that teammembers computer as of right now.
    I think I might add an additional script that is a generic Unity editor script, like the grader for this blog suggested, so that all objects
    in the game get the right material.
