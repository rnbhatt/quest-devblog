    <p>
      For the past two weeks, I worked on bug fixing and polishing tasks. 
    </p>
  <strong>Fixing Counterattack</strong>
  <p>
    In the Counterattack minigame, projectiles (currently <em>still</em> using the 
    temporary axe sprite!) fire out from around the battle box, then fall inwards towards the player. The player must parry (hit the space key while moving in a direction)
    three of the projectiles in order to win the minigame. If any of the projectiles collides with the player, or if the player does not parry three
    projectiles before the timer runs out, the player loses the minigame. There's no penalty for losing minigames as far as I'm aware, but parrying fewer
    than three projectiles means that the player deals less damage to the enemy.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the entirety of the project thus far, the counterattack minigame was impossible to complete. The first issue was frame rate scaling. The minigame did not account
    for the game's frame rate, so if the player was running without vsync enabled, the game would run far too quickly to be possible. I fixed this by moving the 
    projectile logic from Update to FixedUpdate, and adding a RigidBody with interpolation enabled to ensure that it looked good at high frame rates. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The second issue was that parrying the projectiles didn't work. No matter what the player
    did, the projectiles would always hit the player and zero parries would register. There were two components to this issue. First, there was a bug
    in the code that detected if a parry was successful. Physics.OverlapCircle takes a <em>world space</em> input coordinate, but we were passing a
    local space coordinate. This part of the minigame never worked, even when it was in the canvas, so I suspect that whoever wrote this was not aware
    of the coordinate space requirement. Second, the projectiles did not remove themselves from the scene after they were parried, meaning that 
    they would always collide with the player. A simple Destroy call in the projectile collision detection fixed this. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that this minigame is fixed, the game is now playable! Some balancing is still required. 
  </p>
  <strong>Shadow Rendering</strong>
  <p>
    At present, our game looks very flat. It is difficult to tell where objects are depthwise, and what objects are obstacles versus walkable terrain.
    Our art team is currently fully stacked with work, so I decided to implement a system that automatically generates shadows for any sprite in 
    the scene. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The script is easy for our developers to use. Just attach it to any object that needs a shadow, and on Start, the script will create shadows for every
    object and subobject of that object that has a SpriteRenderer. 
  </p>
  <figure>
      <img src="shadows.png" style="width:100%; max-width:600px">
      <figcaption>Shadows added to all of the market stands in the level</figcaption>
    </figure>
  <p>
    I use some transform trickery that takes advantage of how we render 2D objects in scenes. We do not do per-pixel depth sorting, instead every object
    is given a layer priority, and Unity renders objects according to their layer priority via the Painter's Algorithm. Objects cannot clip into other objects
    in the third dimension. 
    Therefore, I can take advantage of 3D transformations
    without worrying about the shadow objects clipping through objects that are behind them. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The shadow object has a SpriteRenderer which takes the same sprite image as the casting object. It then tints it transparent black, with a small amount 
    of opacity. The object is then given a 3D rotation, which the camera orthographic projection matrix flattens during rendering. The end result is
    a shadow! These shadows make the level look far less flat. 
  </p>
  <p>
    This shadow system is not perfect, though. It only works for static sprites. If an object has an animated sprite, then the shadow will keep the same 
    sprite that the caster had at the moment that the shadow was created, and will not update afterward. I don't believe that we will need this, but if we decide
    that animated characters need to have shadows, then I will look into creating a dynamic shadowing system.
