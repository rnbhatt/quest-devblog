      For the past week, I worked on bug fixing and polishing tasks.

  <strong>Implementing Shadows</strong>
  <p>
    In the previous devblog, I introduced the technology behind rendering shadows for our game. 
    I checked in the script, but I did not add the script to any of the objects in the scene
    because I was unsure of how to integrate it with our external world design tool which overwrites
    any changes made in Unity each time it exports. At the studio work session, I pair-programmed
    with a member of the overworld team to ensure that they were implemented properly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The scenes have two layers. The bottom layer is the result of importing tile data from
    LDtk, the external tool, and on top of that are prefabs like houses, props, and NPCs, which
    are placed manually and not connected to the external tool. For the latter, adding shadows
    was simple, all I needed to do was add the script to the prefabs and then in all scenes that
    they were present in, shadows appeared automatically.
  </p>
  <p>
    The trees were also not particularly difficult, but it took me a while to figure out how they
    worked in order to add shadows to them. These prefabs are connected to the external tool, but they
    also have a randomizer script that runs on each import. From what I could gather by poking at it,
    there is a base prefab named "Tree" that the LDtk importer uses as a stamp. Each instance of the stamp
    is named "Tree-UUID", where UUID is a randomly generated UUID that is stable across imports. By modifying the base
    prefab to add the shadow script, all of the stamp variants get shadows. It turned out that generating the shadows
    on awake was a good idea, because it means that the shadows are always showing the correct sprite, regardless of what
    the randomizer does. Otherwise, I would need to synchronize the randomizer script with the shadow script which may not be
    trivial.

    </figure>
    We decided not to have shadows for the tiles, because this technique won't work for them. The tiled backgrounds get imported
    as one object per tile type, which cover the whole area. The only way to add shadows would be to have the artists draw
    shadowed variants of every single tile, which is out of scope for this project.
